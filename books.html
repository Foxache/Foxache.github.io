		<h4> 🇯🇵 Zenbu Kowashite Jigoku de Aishite / 🇬🇧 Destroy It All and Love Me in Hell by Kuwabara Tamotsu</h2>
		<p style="font-size:small;font-color:#FF7C6B;">Content warnings: Parental abuse, bullying, blackmail, self-harm, suicidal ideation and some sexual content.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed this one! I have read about 3 volumes in and I will heavily reinforce the warning of generalised violence. If you enjoy this sort of thing, toxic yuri type stuff, then it is highly recommended 
		as it sounds right up your alley :} . I do want to mention that there is a big emphasis within the bullying that the main character has an immense adversion to breaking the rules, to which I find relatable and as such did keep my interest longer than I would 
			presume a similar manga (which does not have a character with that characteristic) would. By no means is this an uplifting book! From my experience, if you are already in a sour mood and you suspect reading a violent novel would be a bad idea, yeah this book wouldnt be a 
		great pick; something to keep in mind if you start reading it and don't explicitely enjoy violence in a romance/Yuri</p>
		<div></div>
		<p>What i enjoyed: The illustrations are very detailed, convey emotion or atmosphere excellently, although if you do not enjoy large text in mangas this may be an issue though it isnt often used. The story has a very good way of making you invested in the main
		character, managing to pull and push on your emotions very well; although if you have a different world view than i do i could see how this may become innefective. This book also speaks a good message about supporting those under bullying, and what life can be
			if you do not act upon it, there are many lessons to be learnt from this book if you feel yourself un-empathetic or worried about a similar topic. *note it will not do anything to alleviate any fears about the topic, maybe even worsen them.
			<br>What i didn't like: Some chracters feel unrealistic in their mannerisms and general spech, and/or their character design visually may seem a little far fetched considering the masses' general look espeically considering the school-centred environment. 
		hoenstly not much to pick out anyway, it is pretty decent</p>
		<div></div>
		<h5 style="color:#6BFF88;">Given you are fine with violence:<br>Recommended read :}</h5>
		
		<div></div>
		
		<h2>Yaoi</h2>
		
		<div></div>
		<h4>Semantic Error by J. Soori.</h4>
		<p>honestly i dont remember much of this book. Its meh. I could see how it could be enjoyed though.</p>

		<h5 style="color:#FFEB6B;">Read if it contains stuff that interests you :/</h5>
		
		<div></div>
		
		<h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
		<div></div>
		<h4>What if? by Randal Monroe.</h4>		
		<p>Very interesting! If you like little things to read for like bed or just to keep you entertained for a while. They also upload short animations of some questions to their Youtube channel, which are a very interesting illustrations to interesting questions.
		I would say if you are a quick digester / fast reader you may get through this book quite quickly like I have; good thing there is a sequel. they also do small comics! Search xkcd.com</p>
		<div></div>
		<p>What I liked: Very good "what if" style of questions, and they feel rooted in good and advanced logic , yet still very understandable to the average reader, even readers that might be new to the non-fiction and mostly learning-based section of it.<br>What i didnt like: 
		the print quality is very.. modern. A hardback would have been overkill but nice! Ive had my two books for around a year now and they are showing their wear, if you get picky about that sort of thing be prepared to handle it with more care than a usual book.</p>
		<div></div>
		<h5 style="color:#6BFF88;">Recommended read :}</h5>
		<div></div>
		<h2>Erotic / Lewd</h2>
		<p style="color:CornflowerBlue;font-size: small;">I find it important to note that a lot of these books i end up reading due to a hooking story/blurb or recomendation from friends, as I do not have much interest in lewd for the sake of lewd. 🖤🐘🤍💜</p>
		<p style="font-size: x-small;color:CornflowerBlue;">If i wanted to see naked people, its just easier to log into twitter / DeviArt on a new account and scroll for 2 seconds cause those platforms are... badly managed -w-</p>
		
		<div></div>
		
		<h4>Metamorphosis / 変身 by Shindo L.</h4>
		<p style="font-size:small;font-color:#FF7C6B;">Content warnings: Parental abandonment, self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide, immense drug use, SA / Dubious consent, slight relationship abuse and </p>
		<b><strong><i>This one had... a lot of stuff I hated.</i></strong> You could probably tell considering the length of this description compared to the rest, and it even made me reconsider multiple times giving the name. It fills you with that horrid discomfort you can't shake untill something else distracts you enough, and it can be swift to return.<br>In NO way is this a recommended read. It acts less of a lewd book and more like a PSA of drug use and social abuse that is without any laws or regulations
		while a good amount of lesson <i>that could</i> be learned this manga actually left me in a worse state than anything ive read. Despite the fact that the book contains a lot of content i would not consider fun to read in the first place, the story is abhorrently gruesome not with
		blood (albeit some) but with the raw consequences of bad decisions and the subsquent impossible difficulty of leaving the result. <strong>There are absolutely no physical places in life where you could read this book and come out in a good mood</strong>, if you are happy you come out upset and if you are already upset you come out depressed. Anybody who actually
		believes this to be a erotica / lewd story - while yes it contains nudity and sexual acts, but I mean in the sense of a whole story - I feel are severely mistaken as to what this manga is even trying to convey, albeit horrifyingly and disgustingly. The 'fan service'
		at the end of the book showing the happy ending, while od'ing is tragic, i find it hard to see it as fan service if seeing the happy ending while linking it into hallucinations at the 'bad ending' is horrifyingly tragic, not comforting. The only comfort i obtained was
		at the end where it suggests that the 'actor' (main character) in that manga was still alive and it was a coordinated set, still not much by any means considering what you would have just read.</b>
		<div></div>
		<p>What I liked: Quality of writing is adequate, but it is impertinent to not mention its ability to wrangle emotional whiplash and manipulation to a perfection. Illustrations are of good quality, especially the extras. Easy to read.<br>What I disliked: (basically a tldr of the last paragraph) An actual manga where i would not discredit
		the trigger warnings , if the source you read it from provides them. While the writing is good it leaves you with a sinking despair, which yknow is not fun at all. The source I read it from, did not properly acredit most of the tags (I hopefully assume they did
		 not read it) and the contents are one of stuff i usually avoid like Drug Use, dubious consent/ SA, things of this matter; I find with most modern(ish) manga - or novels similar - that include SA / Dubious consent, they are made for people (who i must admit judge heavily with a flamethrower 
			and gasoline, consider this an admission of bias) who are into the topics mentioned previously so feature them heavily , very graphically or both, which to me makes me want to throw up, cry or both.</p>
		<div></div>
