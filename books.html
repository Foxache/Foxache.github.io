		<h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
		<p>What if? 2 by Randall Monroe.</p>
		
		<h3>Yaoi</h3>
		<h2>Blood Bank Volume 1 by Silb</h2>

		<h2>Completed:</h2>
		
		<h3>Yuri</h3>
		<h2> 🇯🇵 Zenbu Kowashite Jigoku de Aishite / 🇬🇧 Destroy It All and Love Me in Hell by Kuwabara Tamotsu</h2>
		<p>I really enjoyed this oneI have read about 3 volumes in and I highly reccomend it to anyone who doesnt mind a bit of violence in their yuri :}</p
																																							 >
		<h3>Yaoi</h3>
		<h2>Semantic Error by J. Soori.</h2>
		<p>honestly i dont remember much of this book. Its meh.</p>
		
		<h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
		<h2>What if? by Randal Monroe.</h2>		
		<p>Very interesting! If you like little things to read for like bed or just to keep you entertained for a while :}</p>
		
		<h3>Erotic / Lewd</h3>
		<h2>Metamorphosis / 変身 by Shindo L.</h2>
		<b><strong><i>This one had... a lot of stuff I hated.</i></strong> That horrid discomfort you can't shake untill something else distracts you enough.<br>Honestly not a recommended read. It acts less of a lewd book and more like a PSA of drug use and social abuse</b>
